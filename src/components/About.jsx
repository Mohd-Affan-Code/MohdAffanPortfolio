          Hi, I'm Mohd Affan, a passionate self-taught Frontend Developer
          specializing in React.js. My journey into web development began with a
          curiosity to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. I have
          honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Sass, and I’m
          currently exploring Next.js and Redux Toolkit to expand my expertise.
          I enjoy turning ideas into reality through clean, responsive, and
          user-friendly interfaces. My goal is to constantly learn and stay
          updated with the latest technologies in the ever-evolving web
          development field. I'm eager to collaborate on exciting projects and
          bring creative solutions to life. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me
          exploring new technologies or working on personal projects to sharpen
          my skills.
